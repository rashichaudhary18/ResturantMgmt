<a name="terms"></a>
<h2>TERMS & CONDITIONS</h2>
<p><a href="#terms"></a></p>

<p>Restaurant Hub is brought to you by Restaurant Hub Limited (together with its related companies “we” and “us”). These terms and conditions set out below (“Terms”) apply to your use of the Nonu's Restaurant website and the services we provide. By using this website (including by making a booking or setting up an account), you confirm that you agree to these Terms, and to any amendments we make from time to time. Please read them carefully. If you do not accept the Terms you must immediately stop using the website and services.</p>

<h5>Amendments</h5>

<p>We may need to update these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in law or the services that we provide. You are encouraged to regularly check these Terms for any updates. If we make any material changes that may affect you, we will try to notify you by email or by means of a notice on this site prior to the change becoming effective. If you do not agree to those changes you can terminate your Restaurant Hub account at any time.</p>

<h5>Making a Booking or Order</h5>

<p>We provide users with the ability to make bookings at participating restaurants by directly synchronising with the Restaurant’s table reservation system hosted on a booking platform. Once a booking has been confirmed, you will receive a booking confirmation email from the booking platform.</p>

<p>We may also provide users with the ability to purchase discounted dining deals or tickets to food related events, offered directly by restaurants or through third parties. Upon selecting to purchase any of these, you may be redirected to a third party’s website to confirm the purchase, where the terms and conditions of that website will apply. Booking is not always confirmed upon purchasing a deal and may need to be completed separately.</p>

<p>By clicking 'Complete Booking' you agree to receive email and/or text message communications from us about the booking or deal. You will also be preselected to receive other advertising and promotional materials we believe may interest you. You can opt out of receiving these communications by de-selecting the communications tick-box or at any later time by following the unsubscribe process.</p>

<h5>Disclaimer and disclosure</h5>

<p>This website has been developed in an effort to provide users with the ability to make bookings and orders at participating restaurants, and to help keep you informed about restaurant and industry news. However, in presenting you with this information and assisting with reservations, Restaurant Hub is proving a booking and sales platform only and Restaurants are alone responsible for their interactions with you.</p>

<p>While every effort will be made to ensure the advertisements and information contained within our websites is accurate and up to date, we make no warranty as to the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of the information, nor do we assume any legal liability or responsibility for this.</p>

<h5>No-Show Policy</h5>

<p>Nonu's Restaurant is committed to providing superior quality services to users and to the restaurants we work with. To assist us in maintaining a consistently high level of service, users must cancel any reservations that they will be unable to honor at least 120 minutes in advance of the reservation. You may cancel your reservation via the automated email/mobile ‘Confirmation’ communication sent at the time of booking or by calling the restaurant directly.</p>

<p>You may also be required to follow the cancellation policy of the restaurant you book with, which is disclosed at the time the reservation is made and some restaurants may require a debit or credit card number to finalize your reservation. In order to use the reservation services for these restaurants, you must provide valid debit or credit card information. To confirm that the debit or credit card information you have provided is accurate, we may place a temporary authorization on your debit or credit card at the time you provide your debit or credit card information. After we verify that your debit or credit card information is accurate, usually within a few days, the authorization will be removed. Restaurant Hub will only use the debit or credit card information you provide in the ways described in our privacy policy.</p>

<p>The restaurant you book with may have the right under its cancellation policy to make a charge to your debit or credit card in compliance with that policy. Restaurant Hub will not have any liability for any charges made to the debit or credit card account due to any failure to cancel your reservation in accordance with a restaurant’s cancellation policy.</p>

<p>If you fail to honor your reservation (and you did not cancel at least 120 minutes in advance) the restaurant via Restaurant Hub will send you an email letting you know that our records indicate you were a “no-show” for your reservation. If you receive a “no-show” notification email in error, please click here for information on how to dispute it. Your Nonu's Restaurant account will be terminated if you are a “no-show” for four reservations within a 12-month period. Users agree that all final “no-show” determinations will be made by the restaurant acting at its discretion.</p>

<p>If you wish to create a booking history, favourites list or rate a restaurant you will need to register an account with us and provide the information we require.</p>

<h2>ORDER & PRE ORDER</h2>
<p><a href="#order"></a></p>
Doing this will surely help you attract a loyal fanbase of tech-savvy clients who will love to pre-order food. Directly from their own phones. For instance, as soon as they’ll start their day, people can use the app to order ahead food for pickup.</p>

<p>Once they’ll get into their lunch break hour, people will storm to your restaurant and pick up their food, thus skipping the queue. Likewise, if you’re using our system, then your customers will also be able to pre-order food for dine-in. And enjoy a nice eating out experience. (Find out more about this GloriaFood feature).</p>

<p>Customers are now enticed to pre-order lunch from a certain restaurant because they’re promised that they will skip the line. And that they’ll be able to go in and out of the store much quicker, thus saving plenty of time.</p>

<p>So if you have your own restaurant or coffee shop, then the best thing you can do to improve customer satisfaction is to have an online food ordering system integrating the “Order Ahead” feature with the table reservation feature. So basically you’ll enable them to book a table and order their favorite foods in advance. You can even enable them to pay in advance, and optimize the order ahead process even more.</p>

 <p>Every business owner wants to keep their customers happy. Because a happy customer is a loyal customer who will keep coming back to you over and over again.  And not just that, but chances are they will also recommend your business to other people. That’s the very definition of customer satisfaction.</p>

<p>Plus, as you know, word-of-mouth recommendations are as great as the written testimonials on a website, because they will help you pick up more business.</p>

<p>With all roads leading to customer satisfaction, it comes as no surprise as to why tech-savvy clients are now dictating the success of a modern restaurant. Right from its inception. With that said, here’s how restaurant business have adapted to this mobile ordering trend.</p>

<a name="cancel"></a>
<h2>ORDER CANCELLATION</h2>
<p><a href="#cancel"></a></p>
<p>You must notify the participating restaurant immediately if you decide to cancel your order, preferably by phone, and quote your order number. If the restaurant accepts your cancellation, no cancellation fee applies. If the restaurant refuses cancellation, (e.g. preparation of order placed by you has been completed and/or delivery personnel has already been dispatched), we will not be able to refund any order, which has been already dispatched. As a general rule, you shall not be entitled to cancel your order once you have received confirmation of the same from the restaurant. Usually, this is within 5 minutes of placing an order.</p>

<p>If the cancellation was made in time and once the restaurant has accepted your cancellation, we will refund or re-credit your debit or credit card with the full amount within 14 days which includes the initial delivery charge (where applicable) which you paid for the delivery of the Goods or the Services, as applicable. We may cancel a contract/order if the product is not available for any reason. We will notify you if this is the case and return any payment that you have made.</p>

<p>However, in the unlikely event of an item on your order being unavailable, we will contact you on the phone number provided to us at the time of placing the order and inform you of such unavailability. In such an event you will be entitled to cancel the entire order and shall be entitled to a refund in accordance with our refund policy.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that the Participating Restaurant delivers a wrong item, you have the right to reject the delivery of the wrong item and you shall be fully refunded for the missing item/order within 14 days by the restaurant. If the Participating Restaurant can only do a partial delivery (as a few items might not be available), its staff should inform you or propose a replacement for the missing items. We are not responsible for wrong or partial delivery. The issue has to be settled directly with the Participating Restaurant. You can register a complaint with us and if we have similar complaints from other users, we will ensure that such practices are not followed. Any restaurant found continuously following such practices, even after giving regular warnings and improvement opportunities, the restaurant will be removed or blocked from continuing to serve through Nonu's Restaurant.</p>
